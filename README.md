# Age & Gender Prediction using OpenCV and DNN

🚀 A computer vision project that detects human faces from webcam and predicts the **gender** and **age group** using pre-trained deep learning models.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Deep Neural Networks (OpenCV DNN module)
- Pre-trained models from Caffe

## 📦 Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
